# apatton33-weather-dashboard

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to build a weather dashboard.
    It needed a search bar where you can search for a city.
    It will then store the city you searched in the recent history and
    present you with the date and weather for that date in that city.
    It also shows the future weather forcast for 5 days and the date of those days.
    

## Usage
    You can search for weather in cities and look for the future
    forcast of that city.
